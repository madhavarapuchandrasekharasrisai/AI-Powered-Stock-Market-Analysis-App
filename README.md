  - **Multi-Index Comparison**: Compare up to three different indices side-by-side to understand market trends at a glance.

- **Market Breadth**: A dedicated pie chart shows the ratio of advancing, declining, and unchanged stocks for a quick overview of market sentiment.
- **Total Market Overview**: For the **NIFTY TOTAL MARKET** index, the dashboard displays key aggregates like total market cap, average P/E ratio, and top gainers/losers.
- **Auto-Refresh**: The dashboard automatically refreshes every 5 minutes to provide the latest data.

## üöÄ How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- `pip` (Python package installer)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/username/repo-name.git](https://github.com/username/repo-name.git)
    cd repo-name
    ```
    *Replace `username/repo-name` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.*

2.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can create one by running:
    ```bash
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```
    Or, you can install the dependencies manually:
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit pandas plotly-express requests streamlit-autorefresh yfinance groq
    ```

3.  **Set up API Keys:**
    The application uses the **Groq API** for AI-powered market insights. You need to provide your API key.

    - Create a `.streamlit` folder in the root of your project.
    - Inside this folder, create a file named `secrets.toml`.
    - Add your Groq API key to this file:
      ```toml
      GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key_here"
      ```
    - Replace `"your_groq_api_key_here"` with your actual API key obtained from [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/).

4.  **Run the Streamlit app:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run your_app_name.py
    ```
    *Replace `your_app_name.py` with the name of your main Python script (e.g., `app.py` or `dashboard.py`).*

    This command will start the web server and open the dashboard in your default web browser.
